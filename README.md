# ðŸ¤– SKKU Internship Program - Machine Learning Studies

<hr/>

### Purpose

This repository captures my two-week dive into scikit-learnâ€™s classification tools,  as part of my internship at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).  
Under Professor Tamer Abumedâ€™s guidance, my goals are to:

- Get comfortable with the basics of classic machine-learning tools like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and SVMs.
- Master the essentials of preparing data, choosing the right model, measuring performance, and fine-tuning settings to get the best results.
- Get practice with real-world datasets, using scikit-learnâ€™s tools and pipelines.
- Set myself up for research success by keeping track of my studies, methods, challenges, and discoveries.

### Code

All materials are organized by week. Inside each `WeekX-Studies` folder youâ€™ll find:

- **Week-1**: Introduction to Scikit-Learn, basic classifier models, datasets, and exercises.
- **Week-2**: Deeper dive into ensemble learning.
